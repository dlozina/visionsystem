FORK of meassurementvisionsystem sw
This project is development of GUI interface and image processing application for precise measurement with 3 telecentric cameras.
We measure diameter of metallic pieces.
In this version we check material for porosity. (surface imperfections)
We meassure height of metallic pieces.\
To run this code with full functionality you will need to have HALCON runtime dongle key or licence or just remove HALCON reference and parts of code that use HALCON operators.

This is how GUI looks, it has plain and simple "industrial" design: (GUI is on Croatian, we did it for Croatian customer)\
